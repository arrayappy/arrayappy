## Hey, I'm Appala Naidu

With over three years of experience in software engineering, I’ve worn many hats at startups — from full-stack development to leading entire technology stacks and managing production services. However, my most robust expertise lies in backend development, where I've designed and optimized APIs, architected databases, and enhanced system scalability. I've made several contributions to open-source at [Mish-Fit](https://github.com/mish-fit) & [GDSC-RGUKTS](https://github.com/gdsc-rgukts).

My quick adaptability helps me experiment and roll out solutions faster. I’m deeply passionate about distributed systems and blockchains, where I focus on building systems that efficient, scalable, and always reliable.
