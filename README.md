## Hey, I'm Appala Naidu

I'm currently working at [Zobaze](https://zobaze.com) as a full-stack engineer. With over three years of experience in software engineering, I've had the opportunity to work at startups â€” from full-stack development to leading entire technology stacks and managing production services. I've also made several contributions to open-source at [Mish-Fit](https://github.com/mish-fit) and [GDSC-RGUKTS](https://github.com/gdsc-rgukts). My experience spans both in Web2 and Web3 environments. I'm deeply passionate about distributed systems and blockchains, where I focus on building systems that are efficient, scalable, and reliable.

Check out my recent work on [Privy](https://privy-devnet.vercel.app) - a true-trustless decentralized app for receiving private messages securely and spam-free through a shareable link. I've optimized [Solana programs](https://github.com/arrayappy/solana-native-rust-q4) with compute units reductions up to 90% through low-level optimizations using unsafe Rust and Assembly as part of the Turbine3 program, and [Staked Steps](https://github.com/arrayappy/staked-steps) - a gamified DeFi fitness app where users can stake ETH tokens and compete in step-counting challenges.

I'm a former [Google Developer Student Club](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc) Lead and [Microsoft Student Partner](https://mvp.microsoft.com/studentambassadors), where I founded communities and organized technical workshops and hackathons to foster student collaboration.
